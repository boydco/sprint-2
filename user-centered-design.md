#key principles of user-centered design in my words

1. build for your target audience. When planning a build, consider the specific people you are creating software for and orient the details to that group of people.

2. Maintain some semblance to normalcy so new users can do so without any learning curve and don't get frustrated using your product. If going with a new slick design, have an explicit reason for that change. When possible maintain conventions to make it easy as possible for user.

3. Don't add irrelevant information, keep it succinct and in plain language to communicate with the user.

4. Don't make them think! Users don't like to have to think how to use something, they just want to use something. Minimizing the tasks or time it takes for someone to learn what you're creating.

5. Ensure there is feedback so users know if they've been successful so they're not left in a state of wondering if their action was successful whether this is a transaction or passing a level in a game. Feedback should be present often even for minimal tasks.

6. Ensure there are options for navigation at any page. Include 'escape routes' so users can get out of a series of pages if they need to. Also include progress bars for downloads, or range or page numbers if there are a series of pages so users know how far they are from completing an action.

7. Make little friction as possible. Every task should provide simple ways of completing it. The user should be able to take the controls and complete any given task.

8. All information should be presented in a clear manner. CSS roles should be implemented to make the presentation as frictionless as possible by utilizing spacing and colors to present the information in the most clear way to complete the task.

9. Assist the user along the way. Tool tips and information how to use buttons should be labelled clearly and as close to those elements as possible.

10. Minimize errors for user. That is help users down the correct path to completel their task. In places where they may make an error have tests that can help correct the user in those places rather than getting further ahead and fixing an error. Error messages should be in clear english, not coded jargon users may not understand.

## Reflections

I think a few of these overlap in a lot of ways, but they're important in knowing how to build things that users can use, because ultimately what's the point in building web applications that no one wants to use.

One thing I've picked up from this list and other books I've read is the idea, "Don't make them think". That is to say, make it so easy a user doesn't have to think about what they're doing and just do it to solve the task they want. We've reached a point where most people know how to navigate through a web application or website, but still maintain those conventions and make it as intuitive as possible.

I think there are reasons to break some of these rules, but only when an explicit reason is given, but more times than not, it's best to utilize a list like this as a check-list when designing and building applications.

## ROI of UCD Video Reflections

I really enjoyed this video. I was a bit surprised to see UX design account for 3 out of 12 reasons projects fail. Then the repercussions of those failings or shortcomings can amount to nearly $1 million dollars lost over a year. With a 100,000 investment, UX Roi can be nearly 900,000. It helped put into context the importance of a design when working with users, stakeholders and other business elements. It's always important to remember dev doesn't happen in a vacuum. There are almost always business elements at stake and the people who are going to pay the most for developers want to see the highest ROI they can produce.

what's interesting was the various reasons and measurements to take when working on an application. I'd be interested in learning more about UX testing and different methodologies for that.
