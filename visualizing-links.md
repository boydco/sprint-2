1. What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?

Don't do it. Reserve underlining for links.


2. How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:

Brightness: unvisited should be brighter and more saturated than for visited linkes.
Hue: The hue should be same, the visited should just be darker and 'used'

3. What is a "perceived affordance"? Hint: Google is your friend. (OK, not really, but the search is nice.)

Perceived affordance is the art of designing buttons and links on websites so users know that they can click on it just by the look of it. Amazon buy now buttons are an example of this. The trick is to make this possible even for novice users of the web. Perceived affordance is important because it helps to establish a trust factor between website and user.


4. When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?

Assuming links are coloured, underlines can be eliminated when they are in navigation menus and other lists of links. This is only afforded when design indicates an areas function. It's also important to keep underlines when red/green colors are used to help for color blindness and also keep underlines when audience includes high number of low-vision users.


5. Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?

No, only keep it reserved for links. Blue is the color with the most perceived affordance.


6. What are link titles and how might you use them?

Link titles are the titles of the link users can see to predict where the link will take them. It's the basis of SEO as contextual links can increase the perceived afforrdance of that link and increase the amount of users that go through to that page. Name of the site and context of page are important to include in link title but it's best to keep it at 60 characters or less.
