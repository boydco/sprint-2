# Agile Dev Notes

The agile method is interesting in that it focuses more importance on small iterations and adapting as the product comes to life. I think this is a lot better in dev than coming up with one plan at the beginning and making sure you follow that one straight path.

It also helps the working relationship between client and dev team, because they are able to grow trust over time and over small iterations. It doesn't turn into a project where a team might have spent 4 months working on something, only to find the client doesn't know exactly what they want, and they need to spend an additional 4 months making something new. It works better to be on the same page early and often. This also helps keeps teams focused and aligned.

By using agile methodologies in development, it's easier to implement new features and changes that a client may want on the fly rather than having to go back and do things over again. It's interesting delivery is made on a weekly basis.

It's interesting there are different agile methodologies. From what I've seen it's often common to include multiple methods within a team to achieve the desired results.

TDD is interesting and something I often see that dev teams are working on. I think the fact it is kind of working backwards from a solution and building the code from the solution. This probably makes it easier to make it clean and short as possible rather than building code from the start and end up having a lot of code and not knowing where to cut it. This is something I look forward to learning more about.

The idea of kanban was a bit confusing, but I think i've gotten the gist of it. I'm keen to discover examples of all these in action, and/or learn real-world applications why a dev team or company may prefer one method over the other.
