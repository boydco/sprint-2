Social Capital.

To me, social capital is the degree of comfort and accountability within a culture that allows everyone to reach a point where they want to perform their best for a collective good. Cultures that are rich in social capital welcome constructive conflict because everyone wants to achieve the best and understand they may not always have the correct answer. The building blocks of social capital thus are trust and empathy, that you can look from other people's points of view and trust they are doing the same.

Trust and empathy are vital for success in life. Not only business ventures, but how do you build successful relationships if not for trust and empathy? It's like an American football team, no one quarterback could win the super bowl if they didn't have trust in their offensive line.  And vice versa, who would want to work harder if they knew they couldn't trust their teammates?
