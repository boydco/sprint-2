A couple of these surprised me. The first couple with grey on light grey failed but seemed like it would pass because I could see it fine. I wasn't too surprised the highly contrasted red and green didn't pass because red/green color blindness is a pretty common thing, thus I wonder if that is the reason that failed all the tests despite being highly contrasted.
