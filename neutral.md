I felt it a little dry and annoying of an article while I agree with the premise. I think especially in dev, historically has been a male-dominated industry, there needs to be a concerted effort to make everyone feel welcome and not alienate anyone based on wording and vernacular used in the industry. I think it's just common sense to treat everyone equally and felt this article to be a bit pedantic but then again, not everyone has the same background as me and may feel differently so I guess it may be beneficial for some. 

I also thought it was interesting that the source was from my alma mater.
