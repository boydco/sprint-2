A time I showed empathy.


During my time at university, I worked in the international studies office. I had to do a lot of presentations. For some of them, I used to go to the Michigan State campus in downtown Detroit to speak with local high school students about international study opportunities and the possibilities those could open up by going to university.

I tried my best to be empathetic, but some of these kids didn't have parents, some were from extreme poverty and some had issues that were foreign as things on the other side of the world from me. These kids were trying their best to feed themselves and not get shot or caught up in gangs. I was from a decently well-off suburban area, why should they listen to me?

It's incredibly difficult to be empathetic in some situations, but I'm not sure not having similar experiences makes it impossible. I think the most important thing to do in that point is realize everyone is human and they experience similar feelings so that's the points I tried to convey. Being honest that I don't know how tough things are for them, but tried my best to convey respect towards them. It definitely wasn't perfect and I may have been a joke to some of them, but a couple of them told me they want to travel abroad in college and go to Italy or Australia. It was worth it because it showed me that others can find possibility within themselves if someone else shows them a little empathy.
